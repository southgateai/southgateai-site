      title: 'Postulate 0: It is not sufficient to choose one prediction of the future and create defenses adequate to only that future'
      subtitle: 'An optimal defense must be successful in a large subset of plausible realities'
      text: |-
        **Status:** Considered self-evident  
        **Provisos:** Optimisation to a 'lucky guess' of the nature (or subset of natures) of reality can outperform the wider posture  
          
        This postulate extends the problem set to include a selected subset of all plausible views of the constitution of reality.  In particular, the [materialist nature](/reality/#physicalism), or any nature where conscious experience arises solely from physical processes
        within the brain, is only one of many plausible natures considered.  The alternative nature postulated here to illustrate is that macroscopic
        superposition, in the style of Schr√∂dinger's Cat, can be extended to a superposition of neural constellations in which "something external
        gets to choose" which constellation is physically realized.  It joins a wide range of objections to materialism, which remains a useful but
        potentially falsifiable conjecture.
